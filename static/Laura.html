<h4>Professional me

<p>
I am a Software Test Engineer. Currently I do mostly Test Automation because, 
let's be honest: that is what drives agile development. You need to check that 
the changes aren't breaking the core functionality (and preferably not much else either) 
and then you just go ahead and deploy, and then patch later if needed. That is the 
way software development works in today's world. Most of the people who have worked 
with me know that I have a lot of ideas about how testing is not a mandatory rubber 
stamp at the end of the waterfall. A good tester benefits the entire team by 
participating and asking all the right (or stupid, depending on how you look at it) 
questions before any bugs or undesired features have been entered into the software. 
That requires a load of insight and product and business expertise.
