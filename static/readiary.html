<b>Andrzej Sapkowski: Blood of Elves (The Witcher Book 1)</b><br> 
Now we are on to the real adventures of the Witcher. The TV series is just for TV, this feels different, more adventure than just a show. I really do owe for the recommendation to read the Witcher books instead of just mindlessly watching picture perfect TV version. Needless to say, as I write this review I have already started to read the second book.
</P>
<P>
<b>Andrzej Sapkowski: The Last Wish: Introducing the Witcher (The Witcher Saga Book 0)</b><br> 
Well, this is a book of the Witcher TV series, so there is not that much new to me, because I have seen the TV series. But it is a start.
</P>
<P>
<b>Erik L'Homme: Quadehar the Sorcerer</b><br> 
This YA book was recommended to me by a friend. It has everything you can ask for: knights, sorcerers, and a remote island setting. I loved reading it and promptly ordered the other two parts from Amazon. I can't wait for them to arrive!
</P>
<P>
<b>Robin DiAngelo: White Fragility</b><br> 
This book made me cringe so much. I read it over several months, putting it away so many times. But I had to return, hoping to understand what is wrong with race in America. I am still not sure, but I guess I understand white denial off racial issues a bit better now.
</P>

<H3>Jul 20</H3>
<P>
<b>Catherine Ryan Hyde: Stay</b><br> 
I have to admit I did not read the description well enough before buying this book. The book is about helping people stay alive, and it was quite hard for me to read it at times. There is a lot of wisdom, but also a lot of raw feeling.
</P>

<H3>Jun 20</H3>
<P>
<b>Martha Wells: Network Effect. A Murderbot Novel</b><br>
Another Murderbot book I enjoyed tremendously. I actually like Murderbot so much I decided to buy physical copies of the first four books to give to my daughters so they can read them too.
</P>
<P>
<b>Barbara O’Neal: When We Believed in Mermaids</b><br>
This is a book about a doctor who goes to search for her sister who was believed to be dead. I bought the book because I wanted to read something light but intriguing. And I got what I ordered: happiness peppered with disturbing memories.
</P>

<H3>Apr 20</H3>
<P>
<b>Matthew Walker: Why We Sleep</b><br>
This is an excellent book and I have been recommending it to so many people already. I love all the information and insight it offers, both the grim and the useful. I consider this a must read for anyone interested in their health and wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
<b>Glendy Vanderah: Where the Forest Meets the Stars</b><br>
Something very light to read when sick. Amazon description says “a mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again”.
</P>
<P>
<b>Kerry Fisher: The Island Escape</b><br>
Romance. New beginnings. What can I say.
</P>
<P>
<b>Kerry Fisher: The Woman I Was Before</b><br>
Apparently my reading has degraded in isolation and now I enjoy light reading that does not require too much thinking.
</P>

<H3> Mar 20</H3>
<P>
<b>Scott Adams: Win Bigly</b><br>
This is a book about persuasion. Or a book about Donald Trump. There is a lot to think about, communication (and negotiation and persuasion) wise. I do disagree on the author’s view on everyone preferring to be bullies, if they only can. Although it might be just the way the world is and my ideology is just wishful thinking.
</P>

<H3>Feb 20</H3>
<P>
<b>Matthew Mather: The Atopia Chronicles</b><br>
This book is another part 1 of a trilogy, or maybe more. I remember now why I don’t care that much for Kindle Unlimited. There is a brave new world and it is thrilling, but of course to find out you have to read the sequel. And maybe the sequel of that.
</P>
<P>
<b>Antti Niittyviita: Storytools of Testing</b><br>
I don’t usually write about books I read for professional development, but this one falls right into the self help category. The book helps you communicate what need to be communicated in order to be successful at what you do. And reframe your profession as a storyteller and a problem solver.
</P>

<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: In the Heart of the Fire (Nameless Book 1)</b><br>
This book is very dark, not sure I want to go that route to read the other Nameless books.
</P>

<H3>Dec 19</H3>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Night Window</b><br>
The final book of the Jane Hawk series didn’t let down.
</P>

<H3>Nov 19</H3>
<P>
<b>James Clear: Atomic Habits</b><br> 
I had been lacking time to read for fun, so during reading this book I started reading for “at least five minutes” every morning. It turned out to be a nice habit. Too bad making my blog posts in time is not an easy habit to tackle.
</P>

<H3>Oct 19</H3>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Forbidden Door</b><br>
</P>

<H3>Sep 19</H3>
<P>
<b>Dennis E. Taylor: We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</b><br>
There was a bit of a lull in the middle and I had to push myself through a slight boredom (I confess I read half of the SEAL book before continuing). Otherwise a good book.
</P>
<P>
<b>Jesse Itzler: Living with a SEAL</b><br>
I started reading this one for a light snack on the vacation. It was funny, and there was some food for thought, too.
</P>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Crooked Staircase</b><br>
The Jane Hawk series keep getting darker and darker. I am not sure if I am a fan of all the psychopaths in this series, but it has me hooked: I want to know how the story ends.
</P>
<P>
<b>Andy Weir: Randomize</b><br>
This Kindle Original was a nice short read. Have I mentioned before that I like sci-fi?
</P>

<H3>Aug 19</H3>
<P>
<b>Martha Wells: Artificial Condition: The Murderbot Diaries</b><br>
<b>Martha Wells: Rogue Protocol: The Murderbot Diaries</b><br>
<b>Martha Wells: Exit Strategy: The Murderbot Diaries</b><br>
Yes, I did go for the sequel already. All of it. And I loved it.
</P>
<P>
<b>Scott Sigler: Alive (The Generations Trilogy Book 1)</b><br>
<b>Scott Sigler: Alight (The Generations Trilogy Book 2)</b><br>
<b>Scott Sigler: Alone (The Generations Trilogy Book 3)</b><br>
This book (series) is another YA read, recommended for fans of the Hunger Games. There are some plot twists that are really interesting. The author has especiall asked for no spoilers in reviews, so you’ll have to read the books yourself.
</P>

<H3>Jul 2019</H3>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Good Guy</b><br>
I was in the mood for easy holiday reading. Dean Koontz seldom disappoints, although I have started to see the patterns and need to read books from other authors for a change.
</P>
<P>
<b>Matthew Mather: Polar Vortex</b><br>
For easy holiday reads, mental note to self: check if the book is about surviving a plane crash before you decide to read it in an airplane. I survived and enjoyed this book nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
<b>Martha Wells: All Systems Red (Kindle Single): The Murderbot diaries</b><br>
This was an entertaining little book. I love SciFi and there are wonderful elements in this book (series), so I am quite likely to get another one in the (near) future.
</P>

<H3>Jun 2019</H3>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Whispering Room</b><br>
This is the second book in Jane Hawk series. I can’t seem to let go even though the whole idea of people being controlled scares me. The book held me in its grip all the way through. But I resisted buying the next one. For now.
</P>
<P>
<b>Hugh Howey: The Shell Collector</b><br>
This is a sci-fi book with ecological conscience. The seashells are gone and the big nature exploiting companies are to blame. I seem to be stuck with the same authors a lot, but what I can I do: I did like this one as well (although I wish for a better closure).
</P>

<H3>Reading 2017-2019</H3>
<P>
<b>Timothy Ferriss: Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers</b><br>
I wanted to read the insights of successful people. I have to confess I can’t help disliking Tim Ferriss, so I only read stories of/by those people and topics I am interested in. There was quite a lot of insight, so all in all it was good to read this book.
</P>
<P>
<b>Chris Hadfield: An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth</b><br>
This book was recommended to me by a friend. I sort of knew the author from YouTube before starting to read. There is a ton of useful information and I agree: attitude is everything. But the number one take-home for me is aiming to be a zero. I tend to try too hard to prove my usefulness in situations where just being a zero is worth more than potentially messing up.
</P>
<P>
<b>Annie Hopper: Wired for Healing</b><br>
I decided to pick up this book after reading an article about a woman who was allergic to electricity and the book was mentioned in the article. There are a lot of interesting things to learn about the limbic system, and a lot of conditions can be helped by understanding the mechanism the brain reinforces what you have learned. For instance learning that smells make you feel sick you naturally start sniffing for anything that would make you sick and become sensitive to (chemical) scent and get sick from a trace amount of the smell that was originally making you sick. The drawback is that the book is written to sell the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (TM) and a lot of the book is dedicated to testimonials that really aim to sell.
</P>
<P>
<b>Cixin Liu and Ken Liu: The Three-Body Problem</b><br>
I read this book as I was hungry for some science fiction. It is quite different from my usual sci-fi, because it is set in China and the culture is foreign to me. But the story is quite interesting one and worth reading.
</P>
<P>
<b>Andy Weir: Artemis</b><br>
I loved the Martian and wanted to read this, I mean how can you pass by something written by a space nerd software engineer. I was not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
<b>David Allen: Getting Things Done</b><br>
It has been long overdue to re-read this book. I finally got the motivation to do it when I signed up for a big change in my life. There is hardly a better excuse to tweak my productivity and life management toolkit. I am glad I did, I have let a lot of things slip. Of course I am not all GTD in everything I do, but for me writing stuff down on lists reduces stress tremendously. So why not do ToDo lists one notch better.
</P>
<P>
<b>Daniel Judson: The Temporary Agent</b><br>
An easy read between self-improvement books. Apart from too much politics, there actually is an interesting plot out there.
</P>
<P>
<b>Stephen King: On Writing</b><br>
This book was briefly mentioned by Antti Niittyviita in a Software Testing presentation and I figured since my writing quest has a deadline now, I should read some helpful books on the subject. I like Stephen King’s writing a lot, even though quite a lot of his material is overly scary for my taste. This book has a lot of useful information. I especially liked the advice for reading more.
</P>
<P>
<b>James E. Ryan: Wait, What? And Life’s Other Essential Questions</b><br>
James E. Ryan is the eleventh dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. This book is about asking good questions. It is based on his speech to a graduate class. This is a very good set of questions for new graduates and I recommend it to young people. Don’t be afraid of asking questions! Especially good questions.
</P>
<P>
Dean Koontz: One Door away from Heaven</b><br>
What do you find one door away from heaven? The world can be a cruel place and the realism of things not always falling into place neatly touched me as I gulped this book down during my summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
<b>Jack Cheng: See You in the Cosmos</b><br>
A wonderful story about a boy who wants to send a golden iPod to space.
</P>
<P>
<b>Harry Harrison: A Stainless Steel Trio</b><br>
I have read the first two several years ago, but wanted something easy for the summer. This set was just what I needed.
</P>
<P>
<b>Dan Brown: Origin</b><br>
I have read other Robert Langdon books and liked them so as this was on sale it was a no brainer for me to get it on Kindle. Most of the book is set in Spain, and it was nice to know I have seen some of the places (in Barcelona) myself, too. The storyline gives some food for the thought again.
</P>
<P>
Ray Bennett: The Underachiever’s manifesto</b><br>
This tongue-in-cheek book tells you to avoid stress by being satisfied with mediocrity. Some of the stuff is just common sense, but I somehow fail to see the point of this book other than humor.
</P>
<P>
<b>Jonathan Tropper: This Is Where I Leave You</b><br>
This is a funny novel about a dysfunctional family. A nice snack between more serious reads.
</P>
<P>
<b>Phil M. Jones: Exactly What to Say</b><br>
I’m not like most people, so I dislike it when someone claims there are two types of people. So I bet if you’re like me, you’d find most of the advice in this book more suitable to a pushy phone salesperson than a software (test) professional.
</P>
<P>
<b>Ursula K. Le Guin: The Lathe of Heaven</b><br>
I was in need of some light science fiction, but this turned out not to be all that light after all. The hero of this book feels that his dreams shape the reality and he starts seeing a shrink. Things don’t turn out quite the way I expected.
</P>
<P>
<b>Bruce Schneier: Click Here to Kill Everybody</b><br>
I wanted to get back into the information security ideology, long lost in the everyday software testing. There were lot of things in this book reminding me to keep my tinfoil hat nice and tight.
</P>
<P>
<b>Patrick M. Lencioni: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</b><br>
This was prompted by Dawn Hayden in Helsinki Testing Assembly 2018. I wanted to educate myself more on team dynamics, as I have been a member of dysfunctional teams for a while. There was some useful information for me.
</P>
<P>
<b>Marie Rutkoski: The Winner’s Trilogy</b><br>
I was in the mood for something light to read. Well, this trilogy suited the occasion although it was nothing to write home about.
</P>
<P>
<b>Rachel Caine: Stillhouse Lake</b><br>
<b>Rachel Caine: Killman Creek</b><br>
These thrillers were easy reading to kill some time. There would have been a third volume as well, but at the end I was not feeling like it.
</P>
<P>
<b>Dan Brown: Digital Fortress</b><br>
This is an old book by Dan Brown. Despite of the age (this book was published 11 years ago) I enjoy a good techno thriller every now and then.
</P>
<P>
<b>Jack Arbor: The Russian Assassin</b><br>
This book is the first of a series of Max Austin books. It was an easy read and a nice snack, but I did not buy the other books in this series, at least not yet. Maybe when I need something straightforward to read again.
</P>
<P>
<b>Craig Anderson: Level Up</b><br>
This is a book about the gaming world. Light and easy read, a bit of naivety as a spice.
</P>
<P>
<b>Steven Gould: Jumpers</b><br>
For some reason this book felt old, like it was written a long time ago. I was surprised to find out it was from the nineties. I had a bit of a rough start with it as well, not getting caught in the flow. Eventually I ended up reading several other books before getting back to this one.
</P>
<P>
<b>Katie Williams: Tell the Machine Goodnight</b><br>
An interesting concept of AI figuring out how to improve your happiness is the basis of this books where a mother is torn by her son just not wanting the happiness that the machine could bring him. This book was a bit of a disappointment to me: it is a collection of little tidbits of people’s lives but a lot was left untold.
</P>
<P>
<b>Laurie Frankel: This Is How It Always Is</b><br>
Rosie has always wanted a daughter. Her fifth child is Claude who wants to be a girl when he grows up. This book is a touching story of a child who is struggling with meeting expectations and keeping secrets.
</P>
<P>
<b>Jillian Michaels: 6 Keys</b><br>
I am somewhat interested in learning how to live healthier as age creeps on me. There is a truckload of scientific research in this book, but ads for the app (with a monthly fee) are a bit annoying at times.
</P>
<P>
<b>Dean Koontz: The Silent Corner</b><br>
I was in for some light reading so I grabbed a suspense novel by Dean Koontz. There are sci-fi elements that make this book interesting, but the bare bones of it is your average thriller.
</P>
<P>
<b>Margot Lee Shetterly: Hidden Figures</b><br>
I am sorry, but this book was outright boring. The people are introduced like it was a history lesson, and they have no character. The events and facts were mostly interesting (although I have no idea what the colleges and sororities mean to the Americans) Halfway through the book I gave up and watched the movie, which was surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
<b>Hugh Howey: Machine Learning</b><br>
This collection of short stories was interesting and fun to read. There are some recurring themes though. Yes, I did already know that artificial intelligence is already here, but the Roomba which escapes to ruin the world was a fun novel idea to me. I will have to guard my vacuum cleaner robot better in the future. :-D
</P>

<H3>1.6.2019
Neal Stephenson: Seveneves</H3>
<P>
The world as we know is coming to end end… This has been the theme in my reading lately. So, this is another story of survival. The setting is very intriguing, but the story drags on a bit (the book is very long, like Stephenson’s books tend ot be). Also, I wasn’t very happy with the ending.
</P>

<H3> 26.6.2017
Joe Hart: The Dominion Trilogy</H3>
<P>
This YA trilogy consists of “The Last Girl”, “The Final Trade” and “The First City”. These books tell a story from yet another post-apocalyptic world where there is a shortage of women after a worldwide epidemic has reduced the birthrate of female infants to less than 1 percent. I have to confess I devoured the books.

</P>

<H3> 7.5.2017
Brené Brown: The Gifts of Imperfection</H3>
<P>
This book gave me a lot to think about. The bottom line is to let go of who you think you should be and embrace who you are. What really hit me home was her chapter of being goofy and laughing. I was raised to believe you are never going to be taken seriously and get anywhere or anything good in life if you laugh and act silly. So I tried to suppress all fun for years. It has taken me a long time and unconditional acceptance of someone very dear to me to be able to let go of who I am supposetd to be and learn to be funny and childish again. Reading this book was to remind myself that this is the right path.

</P>

<H3> 20.4.2017
Arthur C. Clarke: Childhood’s End</H3>
<P>
Childhood’s End was written quite a long time ago (it was published in 1953), and in some ways the age is showing. Recently I have been drawn more to the old-fashioned idea of science making Earth a wonderful place to live in. And Childhood’s End delivers a hefty dose of that. But it is more complicated than that. All in all, I enjoyed reading this book.

</P>

<H3> 29.3.2017
Neil Gaiman: Norse Mythology</H3>
<P>
The stories of Thor and his gang, retold by Neil Gaiman. I knew many of the stories already (they are folklore anyway) but the storytelling is captivating and I enjoyed reading the tales (again).

</P>

<H3> 1.3.2017
Bruce Schneier: Data and Goliath</H3>
<P>
Schneier writes about important issues, about your data and who has access to it and what they can do with it. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone, but it is a bit of a tough read. It took me months to finish it up. And I consider myself tech savvy. I wonder if a layman could actually get past the introduction unless they were really enthusiastic about the subject.

</P>

<H3> 12.1.2017
Rachel Abbott: Kill Me Again</H3>
<P>
A murder mystery with an interesting, but somewhat unconvincing plot.

</P>

<H3> 30.10.2016
Saxon Andrew : Gregor’s Run: The Universe is too Small to Hide</H3>
<P>
Yet another Sci-Fi book. The characters could have used more depth, but the plot was quite complex (at least compared to some of my recent book adventures), so it was fun to read.

</P>

<H3> 14.10.2016
A.G. Riddle: The Atlantis Gene: A Thriller</H3>
<P>
The first half or so of this book was very intriguing, but unfortunately it went downhill towards the end. And it is part one of a series (which I will not be following).

</P>

<H3> 6.10.2016
T. Jefferson Parker: The Blue Hour</H3>
<P>
This is a thriller about two detectives searching for a serial killer. Totally my thing. I was late to work on more than one morning because of not wanting to put it down and get my day started.

</P>

<H3> 2.10.2016
Michael Crider: Good Intentions: A Supervillain Story</H3>
<P>
A fun story although it is very much bound to time (it is already “so last year” here and there). This book reminded me of We Could Be Villains where Heroes aren’t as heroic as you’d think.

</P>

<H3> 6.9.2016
Anni Taylor: The Game You Played</H3>
<P>
This book was in the same train with the Girl.

</P>

<H3> 18.8.2016</H3>
<P>
Hugh Howey: Beacon 23
Hugh Howey: Wool
Hugh Howey: Shift
Hugh Howey: Dust

I started reading Beacon 23 because of the similarities with The Martian. I really liked the author’s style and dug right into the Silo series.
</P>
<P>
Tom Lowe: Destiny
This is a book about wannabe professor Langdon. Not anywhere near as good as the real one.
</P>
<P>
Paula Hawkins: The Girl on the Train
Not my usual cup of tea, but this fits right next to The Time Traveler’s Wife

</P>
<P>
Spencer Quinn: Woof
S. J. Delos: So Not a Hero
Sally Green: Half Bad
Rainbow Rowell: Fangirl
Peter Cawdron & Elle Campbell: Hello World
Peter Cawdron: Welcome to the Occupied States of America
I have been reading a load of YA / kid lit. These books were devoured quickly whenever I needed a break from reality (=rainy and cool summer).
</P>

Rob Lowe: Stories I Only Tell My Friends (an Autobiography)
I wasn’t expecting much, the title of the book is too headline-ish for my taste, but I wanted to read something light during Easter long weekend and grabbed this book from a friend’s bookshelf.

I saw Rob Lowe in The Hotel New Hampshire ages ago. My mom was a big John Irving fan and as we found out there was a movie we went to see it. That was when I discovered that there was huge value in reading the original book as I discovered the jokes and puns in their original form. (My mom didn’t know any English, so naturally I had read the Finnish translation of the book from her bookshelf.) I thought he was cute and brought his character to life in a way that would later draw me towards movies, too. So, it turns out he played a significant part in my life.

I also loved The West Wing, but never really followed Rob Lowe’s life (truth be told, I don’t follow any actor’s life, just the careers of the interesting ones). It wasn’t until I read something he had written from Reader’s Digest, that made me think that this guy actually might have something valuable to say. And I figured why not, this might be just the easy reading book I wanted. And sure, it was a journey through being a celebrity, and the ups and downs of it all. Most of the book is about his youth, acting career and wild life in Hollywood. But Rob Lowe turned out to get his act together. And he did have something to say that I found worth reading.
</P>

Mark Wayne McGinnis: Star Watch
I grabbed this book from the sale bin. It was my breakfast read. I did not have a problem reading just one or two chapters at a time until the end (I read the last 20% during the weekend). The plot is somewhat predictable but there are some twists and turns to keep the reader interested.
</P>

<H3> 13.3.2016</H3>

Wim Hof and Justin Rosales: Becoming the Iceman

My entire adult life I have sincerely hated winter. Living in Finland is a cross I have to bear. It is unrealistic to assume I will just magically learn to love winter. So I figured I’ll just set my goal to tolerating it. This book was not a good read for that mindset.

The book tells about the Iceman Wim Hof and his disciple Justin Rosales. They really want to embrace and conquer cold, and break records doing it. They love attention and being famous. They feel powerful in the cold. Me, I just feel miserable (both in the cold and when people are watching me). The basic idea is that you can learn to embrace cold, all you have to do is want it. What if I don’t even want it?

When I was ready to give in, right near the end of the book there are instructions how anyone can become an iceman. Cold showers, putting your hands and/or feet in ice water, running barefoot in the snow. Sounds just plain unbearable. And there I finally found the wisdom in the training. You have to be mindful of how you feel. Don’t force the cold on yourself. This is not the time or place to listen to your ego. (After the initial adjustment) when you feel discomfort it is time to stop pushing. Don’t go for new records despite of what the Icemen do. Just listen to your body and it will tell you when it has had enough cold. Gradually it will get easier (they say).

I have been practicing the “cold” showers for a while. I can tolerate lukewarm at best, but little by little I am making progress. Cool showers are easiest after a run, or after sauna. Never really pleasant (at least not yet). But even if I never truly get used to the cold, my skin has been less dry and itchy since I started lowering the shower temperature towards the end.

There is an outdoor pool at the local swimming hall. The other day I checked the temperature reading and it said +5C. There is no way I am going in there! Maybe the idea will start resonating with me after a few months of lukewarm showers. I guess I might be ready for the outdoor pool sometime in May or June…

Gary Klein: Seeing What Others Don’t. The remarkable ways we gain Insights
I find this subject intriguing. How can you learn something like insights? I was skeptical. But then again, I used to think happiness was a trait and it turns out it is actually a skill. So, I grabbed this book to find out. There are a bunch of stories and examples of insights. They are interesting and the book dissects them so that the reader learns what insights are and how they occur. And yes, there are ways you can support insights, just like there are ways that you (and unsurprisingly your work culture, too) can suppress insights. The bottom line is (for me at least) that once you open your mind to insights and cultivate them, you can learn to have more of them.
</P>

<P>
Philip Reeve: Mortal Engines (Predator Cities)
This is yet another YA book. I heard of it from a friend of my daughter, who had enjoyed it, and naturally I had to give it a shot. The book is set on a post-apocalyptic world where cities are moving on wheels, devouring smaller towns as they go. This is where a bunch of kids end up working together to stop power hungry leaders’ plot to rule the world. I am quite likely to read more books in this series.
</P>

Karen Joy Fowler: We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves
Rosemary Cooke talked so much as a child she was told to start her stories in the middle. So this story begins in the middle, too. Somewhere along the way Rosemary got rid of all the unnecessary words in her life, and the book tells us why and how that happened. For a more personal note: I don’t really know what to say about this book. I learned a lot about psychology, but I didn’t think it was a great story.
</P>

<H3> 6.12.2015</H3>
<P>
Audrey Niffenegger: The Time Traveler’s Wife
This story is about an involuntary time traveler and his spontaneous disappearances, and appearances. But it is as much a story about his wife, who is patiently waiting for him to come back, making her paper art, pretending everything is normal, worrying about her husband. I found the book intriguing, almost haunting at times.
</P>

<H3> 19.11.2015</H3>
<P>
Larry Niven: The Man-Kzin Wars
I grabbed the first book of Man-Kzin wars. The book surely did not disappoint. The characters are complex, like real life characters often are. There is a lot out there to discover, alien worlds and consequences of the war. More books form this series have found their places in my reading queue.

Gerard E. Mullin: The Gut Balance Revolution
I recommend this book for a scientifically minded person who wants to eat better for their health and/or has digestive issues.I have been reading this book for a couple of months. There is a lot of information to digest (pun intended). At first I thought this was another crappy “see, I lost weight this way, and so can you” book but there is a lot of research behind it all. And there are references to everything, too.

The gut balance revolution consists of three phases. The first one is an initialization phase, where you kick-start building your gut flora. The second is where you lose any extra weight (yes, the book is heavily focused on weight loss, because many people with digestive issues are overweight). The third is an upkeep phase, where you learn to eat for your gut health for life. The book highlights Dr Gerry (as he likes to call himself throughout the book) approved super-foods for each phase, some of which aren’t necessarily regarded as such in health centered magazines and blogs, but the book explains why. For instance I thought I knew all I needed to know about omega-3s, but I didn’t know that eating salmon enhances insulin sensitivity.

There are meal plans for two weeks for each phase. Even though I have’t gone through the meal plan yet, the recipes look pretty doable. There are some ingredients that are not trivial to find in grocery stores here, but most ingredients are just real food. Of course in my case there is no such thing as “leftover green tea”, but I guess I can make a new cup of tea just for the blueberry smoothie. Another thing I am not very thrilled about is the use of whey protein powder. But on the other hand I do understand the need of protein without adding a load of calories (hello, nuts), so I will give the protein powder a try.

If you adopt the diet you are essentially overhauling your entire life. The book talks not only about what you eat, but also gives guidelines on when and how to eat. The book also talks about stress management and gives simple, yet effective exercise instructions. There are chapters on yoga, meditation and sleep, too. Overall, the book is a solid manual for living a healthy life.

(The rest of the post is about my own health, so if you are just here to learn about the book, that’s it.) I was a bit discouraged at having to eat a lot of processed food (ready made meals from the grocery store nuked in the microwave oven) for my surgery recovery. So I decided to just relax and read on and worry about the adaptation part later.

I do want to give my body the best possible building blocks for recovery and general health. So I do what I can, given the limitations. It is really tough to cook when standing hurts and you are on painkillers that make you drowsy and unable to concentrate. For several weeks I couldn’t even do my own grocery shopping. Actually I still can’t just go grocery shopping, because I need crutches to move around and am not allowed to drive. But at least now I can tag along and point at things I want to buy. I committed to cutting back on sugary treats. Knowing how easy it is to get to the vicious cycle of comfort eating causing feeling lethargic and giving a perfect opportunity to self loathe, I have been happier with as clean eating as I can (given the circumstances). Making better choices is easier when backed up with a load of research. Once I have recovered enough (but before starting a heavy aerobic exercise routine) I will give phase one a test drive and we’ll see how it feels. I am hoping at least some of the recipes will make their way to my regular meal rotation.

<H3>Josi Russell: Caretaker</H3>
<P>
I do not necessarily recommend this book. The characters aren’t particularly interesting and the plot has some vagueness that bothers me.

I have bought other cheap-ish books for my Kindle to fuel my reading hunger. Generally, if a book has been a disappointment I have said nothing. Now, regardless, I feel I should. So, some of this rant has not that much to do with Caretakers, but with the fact that I have fallen to the idea of more being better with My Amazon Kindle purchases. I guess I would have been just fine, if I hadn’t read The Martian right before, and started Larry Niven’s The Man-Kzin Wars before writing up this review.

In general I like action movies, and crime to some extent. For instance The Criminal Minds is very intriguing, but it tends to be too dark at times. And the same applies to books. The good crime / action (thrillers) are just too dark (or scary) to consume on daily basis. Science fiction gives possibilities for adventure and action with a twist of science. And that is why I gravitate towards it heavily.

Caretaker is a science fiction book. The setting is a spaceship where the passengers are happily in cryo-sleep, waiting to get their new distant home. Things don’t go as expected. Sounds like a good setting tor an adventure, but I did not like the vagueness and shallowness of the characters. Come on, you can have anything for aliens, but I don’t like my aliens to be stereotypes. The good and the bad guys can’t just be good alien races and bad alien races. Also, when the ending leaves you with “no, that can’t have happened” moment or two, I don’t consider the book a success. Yes, it is science fiction, anything can happen. But it does deserve some sort of a plausible explanation. (That is what I mean when I say the science feels solid in a book: I feel that things could have happened the way they did.)

The bottom line is that a book from an author who does his (or her) homework well is worth the price. I should not waste my time reading books that are a dime a dozen just because I can cheaply fill my reading device with content.

<H3> 20.10.2015 Andy Weir: The Martian (+movie)</H3>
<P>
The story is out as a motion picture and I have heard praise of the book and decided to grab it. The book is written (mostly) as the log of an astronaut who finds himself stranded on Mars. He is a hilarous and resourceful guy. I really enjoyed reading the book. I enjoyed most the picturing of Mark Watney as what I call “an engineer”. He is not going to take it just standing there waiting for someone to fix problems, he does the math, reads the schematics and makes things work. The science part is very believable in the book.

As for the movie, well, it was different. Don’t get me wrong: it is a good movie. You just can’t show someone doing math for hours, so the movie pictures Mark Watney as an astronaut who can do what NASA team comes up rather than a really resourceful guy. The movie was beautiful even though some parts of being stranded on Mars looked less like a fight for survival and more like a field trip. I recommend both of them although I am not sure reading the book right after the movie would be a brilliant idea.

Jilliane Hoffman: Plea of Insanity</H3>
<P>
I had previously purchased a book by this author, and Amazon kindly recommended I read another one. I found this one as hard to put down as the previous one I read. I am still not very good at concentrating on things, and “Plea of Insanity” was a perfect way to spend some time entangled in someone else’s life.

Michelle Gagnon: PERSEFONE Series (Don’t Turn Around, Don’t Look Now, Don’t Let Go)</H3>
<P>
Originally recommended by my teenage daughter, I liked these books. I needed something light (but not boring) to keep me occupied and these books delivered. The young adult thriller winds around kids who have been living on the streets avoiding the system and a rich kid who accidentally gets involved in something bigger than he can handle. The story starts with Noa, a sistxeen-year-old girl, waking up on a table in a warehouse with an IV in her arm and no memory of how she got there.

Dan Harris: 10% Happier</H3>
<P>
The book is actually named “10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works – A True Story” and it actually did help me in identifying the voice in my head and the edge I am concerned about. So yes, there is a to of useful information, but getting there was a bit of a drag. I was all too ready to give in on the entire book when I tried to get through war correspondence and drug abuse to get to the meditation. I do understand it was necessary to get to where Dan Harris is now and I eventually made it and yes, there are actual answers to the questions I have about Buddhism, and things that are actively keeping me from meditation.
</P>

<H3> 16.8.2015
Missy Meyer: Unsung Villains</H3>
<P>
This book is a sequel to “We could be Villains“. I enjoyed reading this book just as much as the first one. There are more adventures, romance, and entertaining plot twists and turns. I recommend both books to geek girls and have already ordered a dead tree version of Unsung Villains to give to my favorite geek girl.

John Green: Looking For Alaska, Paper Towns</H3>
<P>
I first read Looking For Alaska and right after it I read Paper Towns and I think they are, deep down, the same book. Yes, there are differences, but basically: A boy has a crush on a girl. A boy wants to learn more about the girl. The boy realizes that people have different sides, visible to different people, and in different situations. What we think as knowing someone is just an interpretation of what we have seen. And we don’t really know anyone. The end.

</P>

Luke Humphrey: Hansons Half-Marathon Method</H3>
<P>
I bought this book to base my running plan on a high-volume training plan and to read about the background science of it. The bottom line is: this book is not for me. It is for a more serious runner, someone aiming to the podium in a local run. The book is filled with useful advise and the science behind the plan is solid. It is a good read for someone wanting to run a faster half marathon.

</P>

<H3>Gretchen Rubin: Better Than Before</H3>
<P>
I have read the two previous books by Gretchen Rubin and I subscribe to her blog. That said, there wasn’t that much new content for me in this book. Yes, it is a useful collection of things that affect our habits. Probably because I am a Questioner, I am not a huge fan of her tendencies classification (ha ha): I tend to think I do not nicely fall into one category. I have different roles in life and different situations bring out different sides of me. But I do agree: knowing yourself makes it easier to choose what habits you try to make stick, and how.

For some reason the end of the book made me feel like a habit failure. Gretchen Rubin has influenced  so many people with her healthy habits. Even her father’s doctor! I have influenced no one. Despite the obvious fact that habits are contagious, mine aren’t. And I keep wondering what I am doing wrong. Of course at the end of the day what matters is how I fare on things I want to do and be, not how I influence others. But yet. Why?

<H3> 3.4.2015 Scott Meyer: An Unwelcome Quest</H3>
<P>
This is the third novel in Magic 2.0 series. I was curious to see how things can be stirred up in a community of “magicians” and this book makes fun of video game designers. Having done my share of gaming, I enjoyed reading it.

</P>

<H3> 8.3.2015 Jilliane Hoffman: Pretty Little Things</H3>
<P>
I got this book from Amazon sale. I really, really should read the book descriptions more carefully. The book is way darker than just a story of a runaway teen. It was intriguing and I just had to keep reading. But I confess I called the book “horrible” out loud. As a parent of a teenage girl, some of the horrors in the book were right from my worst nightmares. That aside the book was not too predictable, well written and there was depth in the characters. A good read for those who aren’t afraid of online predators. Or those who have an overly protective attitude towards pretty little things.

Robyn Schneider: The Beginning of Everything</H3>
<P>
I grabbed this book from Amazon.com recommendations based on reading The Fault in Our Stars. I find myself enjoying the more relistic young readers’ books more. I do not buy into happy endings where the hero(ine) gets the most special super powers and everything (s)he ever dreams of. In this book everyone gets a tragedy. Because that is how it seems to be in real life.

</P>

<H3> 30.12.2014
Missy Meyer: We Could Be Villains</H3>
<P>
I bought this book immediately after hearing it was out. I didn’t even care what it was about, I had to get it. And it didn’t let me down: I loved it. It is witty, very much like Scott Meyer’s writing, but with a (geek) girl flavor to it. The book is about superheroes and supervillains, seen with a different angle. It is hard to say much while avoiding spoilers, but what I really enjoyed (in addition to the geeky setting) was how the plot mocked the usual cliches of a girl meets a boy story that it seemed to steer toward during the first chapters.

Cameron Diaz: The Body Book</H3>
<P>
Written in nice girlfriendly style The Body Book (The Law of Hunger, the Science of Strength, and Other Ways to Love Your Amazing Body), as the name implies, talks about eating, exercising and sex. There is solid science behind it. Most, if not all, advise is useful. There is no eating and exercising “plan” or promises of quick fix for anything really. There is not much new for me (as I have been educating myself on most of the subjects already), but I’d recommend Cameron Diaz’s book to young women wanting to take responsibility of their lives.

</P>

<H3> 3.11.2014
James Dashner: The Maze Runner</H3>
<P>
The Maze Runner is yet another young adult book due out as a movie. Since I am a big fan of reading the books first I got this one from Amazon to chow down before the movie is available in theatres. I was unfortunately not a huge fan, but I have to admit it has movie potential. I am quite likely to go see the movie, if for no other reason, to use the summer movie tickets I hoarded.

</P>

<H3> 30.8.2014
Maria Turtschaninoff: Anaché</H3>
<P>
Kirja on paimentolaistytön kasvutarina. Siinä liikutaan vahvasti henkimaailman parissa, mutta toisin kuin monissa nykyään kovin tyypillisissä yliluonnollisuuteen perustuvissa nuorten (tyttöjen) kirjoissa, kaikki ei ole loksahdakaan paikoilleen helposti ja hienosti pelkän yliluonnollisen dominoivuuden ansiosta. Suosittelen paikkaansa yhteisössä etsiville (teini-)tytöille.
</P>

<H3>Scott Meyer: Spell or High Water (Magic 2.0, Book 2)</H3>
<P>
This book is a follow-up to Off to Be the Wizard by Scott Meyer (the Basic Instructions comic author). The nerd humor and witty writing style make this book fun to read. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all my (nerd) friends.

</P>

<H3> 29.6.2014
John Greene: The Fault in Our Stars</H3>
<P>
I read this young adults book, because the movie is due out soon. This book does not have the usual happiness and trust involved in many young reader books. The world is not a wish-granting factory. And I guess that made this book feel very realistic. I am looking forward to the movie.

</P>

<H3> 26.5.2014
Terry Pratchett, Stephen Baxter: The Long Earth</H3>
<P>
I am a big fan of Terry Pratchett books for the vivid worlds he can paint in front of the readers’ eyes. In that sense the Long Earth did not disappoint. But I was not too happy with the end. It screamed “there will be a sequel” too soon and too loud to enjoy it until the last page was turned. (That is how I determine truly great books: much I want to see where it all leads and how sad I feel to let go of the story and the characters when I turn the last page.)

</P>

<H3> 25.5.2014
Veronica Roth: Divergent</H3>
<P>
I saw this in the upcoming movies list and since I am a big fan of reading the book before watching the movie I decided to buy the book and use it as a waiting room entertainment. I have recently read other books with the theme of people being forced into groups. The common denominator in these books is not fitting in for one reason or another, something that resonates well with young girls in today’s society as well. Divergent turned out to be a relatively good young reader book, I enjoyed reading it and am looking forward to the movie.

</P>

<H3> 24.3.2014
Phoenix Sullivan: Sector C</H3>
<P>
I picked up this near future medical thriller from Amazon recommendations, because it was cheap. I wasn’t expecting much, and started to read it to get some waiting room entertainment. It did serve the purpose and kept me hooked on the plot well. Scientifically the book is also quite believeable, which is a definite plus.

</P>

<H3> 2.3.2014
Dean Koontz: Innocence: A Novel</H3>
<P>
It is hard to say something about this book apart from the fact that I loved it. The world Dean Koontz builds in the reader’s mind is a dark, yet it could be anywhere and everywhere around us. The book tells the story of a young man who lives in solitude avoiding all human contact. That is until he sees a girl who he reaches out to. It could have been a beautiful love story, but that is not exactly how things went.

</P>

<H3> 19.2.2014
Stephen King: Under the Dome</H3>
<P>
I bought this book because I watched the first few episodes of the TV series.  I heard the book was more believable (scientifically) and wanted to read the story. There does not seem to be much resemblance between the book and the TV series. And in my opinion the book is much better. If you want to like the TV series, don’t read the book before watching.

</P>

<H3> 29.1.2014
NeilGaiman: The Ocean at the End of the Lane</H3>
<P>
I am a fan of Neil Gaiman’s books so naturally I wanted to read this one soon after learning about it. The story tells about an adventure of a seven-year-old boy and like Neil Gaiman stories usually are, it is a dark and strangely captivating story. If you liked Coraline, you are going to like the Ocean at the End of the Lane as well.
</P>

<H3> 19.1.2014
Scott Adams: How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life</H3>
<P>
I learned about Scott Adams’ new book from his blog and I figured I might like to read it to get a new viewpoint to failure. The book is loosely built around overcoming Mr Adams’ speaking problem (focal dystonia), but the reading experience is unfortunately not very smooth due to trying to fit in the advise into a story of something partially unrelated. Adams gives some advise on how to live your life and he makes it very believable. He values energy over passion, and system over goals. You know, the usual stuff: healthy, hardworking people who aren’t afraid of failure usually succeed in life, given some luck. Of course, I am more likely to believe something I already think is making sense. There are some very practical pieces of advise that actually make me suggest this book to people who want to turn their failures into success. Or succeed despite failures.
</P>

<H3> 1.11.2013
Derryl Murphy: Napier’s Bones</H3>
<P>
This book has been sitting on my Kindle waiting for me to read it. On a cold day I decided to plunge into the world of numerate people because love the idea of mixing mathematics with magic. The adventures of Dom and Jenna showed me ways math can be incorporated into everything (not like I didn’t know it already) and also how numbers are everywhere. Being able to tweak numbers to your advantage sounds like it could almost be real, but the book took a quantum leap ahead and made it an epic adventure instead of just using numbers to win in Vegas.
</P>

<H3> 1.10.2013
Dean Koontz: Watchers</H3>
<P>
I needed something good to read, so I borrowed this book from a friend. I really loved reading Watchers. The main character is a former military man who had lost his will to live, and with the help of a genetically enhanced dog finds joy again. Not that it is that straightforward and simple. There are others who are interested in finding the dog as well, and not all of them have good intentions. Some details show a bit of age (the book was written in the 80s), but with all the twists and turns of the plot I found it really intriguing.
</P>

<H3> 8.9.2013
Harry Harrison: West of Eden</H3>
<P>
As I am a big fan of the adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat, I wanted to read Harrison’s take of an alternative future (well, actually past) of humans where there are sentient animals whose beliefs and culture clash with those of men. I enjoyed the book a lot as it went back and forth, telling the story of a man, and the story of the murgu (the sentient animals, who are like dinosaurs could have been, if they were let to evolve).
</P>

<H3> 19.8.2013
Daniel Kahneman: Thinking, Fast and Slow</H3>
<P>
The subject of this book is fascinating. I learned a lot while reading it. The only drawback is Kahneman’s rambling writing and occasionally I found the book almost boring. It also took me a while to get it read, because I gave up on the book several times to read something else, but ended up continuing it again because of the interesting subject.

</P>

<H3> 6.8.2013
Eoin Colfer: Plugged</H3>
<P>
I bought this book because I enjoyed Eoin Colfer’s witty writing style in the adventures of Artemis Fowl. The hero of this book is middle aged ex-military guy who left Ireland for a better life on the other side of the Atlantic ocean and ended up working as a bouncer in New Jersey. His average, borderline boring life is changed  dramatically when people around him start winding up dead.

And yes, the witty writing style is very much present and I enjoyed reading this book.
</P>

<H3> 12.7.2013
Gregory Maguire: Wicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</H3>
<P>
I have read my Oz stories ages ago, so I know about the little girl called Dorothy and her adventures. Recently we also saw the movie “Oz the Great and Powerful”. When I saw Wicked mentioned in a blog I figured I could complete my view on Oz by reading it. All three viewpoints are different and made me think about how different the same events look and feel from the different perspectives. The beginning was a bit slow, I was soon absorbed into the habits and politics of a faraway world. I liked reading this book although it does haves a bit too much politics for my taste.
</P>

<H3> 12.5.2013
Scott Meyer: Off to Be the Wizard</H3>
<P>
Amazon.com says about this book “Off to Be the Wizard is a fun, comedic novel about computers, time travel, and human stupidity, written by Scott Meyer, the creator of the internationally known comic strip Basic Instructions.” I don’t think I could have summed the book up any better myself. I really enjoyed reading this book. There is a nice plot to the book, but Scott Meyer does have a talent of making fun of stupidity. Regardless of age and time, stupidity is something to laugh about, as long as it is not your own stupidity people are making fun of. And maybe even then it might be best to just laugh.
</P>

<H3> 18.4.2013
George R. R. Martin: A Dance With Dragons</H3>
<P>
I finally read the fifth book of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, when you are talking about the books, Game of Thrones if you are a TV fan. I did enjoy it although not as much as the first ones. I do understand that the game of thrones is a complex one and heads will roll. Actually, that was one of the reasons why I got interested in the book series: the plot is not straightforward and George R. R. Martin is surely not shy to kill a loved character. I was not a big fan of the TV series because it was really confusing to tell who is who and this book made me re-live some of that experience by calling already familiar characters with new names according to where they are and with whom. Regardless, it is quite likely that I will be buying the next book just to find out what happens next.
</P>

<H3> 15.2.2013
The Steel Remains by Richard K. Morgan</H3>
<P>
I have read a bunch of Takeshi Kovacs books and enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to this one (borrowed from a friend). Unfortunately I didn’t like it that much and actually put it away for a while. But I very seldom leave books unfinished and this one certainly does not deserve such faith. So I just finished it. And it did get better towards the end, when the big picture started to form. Some surprises were also thrown in for good measure.
</P>

<H3> 27.1.2013
Marked: A House of Night Novel by P. C. Cast and Kristin Cast</H3>
<P>
This is one of the books my daughter read and I wanted to read it too. It was mentioned by her email pen pal as something she liked. So did my daughter. It is a book about a girl finding her place in a new school. Frankly, it could have done without the supernatural parts, but everything is nowadays about vampires and heroines having super special abilities others can only dream about.
</P>

<H3> 12.1.2013
Mark Russinovich: Zero Day: A Novel</H3>
<P>
I was intrigued by the idea of a science fiction novel in the computer world. This book was published last year and the events unfold in present day, or very near future. Combining drama and people with actual events the book feels quite well researched. (That means that I did not laugh out loud at the details given for cyber crime.) The amount of “leetspeak” bothered me a lot, as I haven’t seen anyone legally adult type that way and all communication in computer world in the book seemed to be that way. For some reason I don’t find it credible for security professionals to desperately need to buy a vowel.
</P>

<H3> 21.11.2012
Lori Brighton: The Mind Readers</H3>
<P>
I got this book from the “free” section of Kindle store. After finishing the latest adventures of Artemis Fowl (I haven’t really written about them, but I have read all the Artemis Fowl adventures that have been published) I decided to fill the void with something easy. And grabbed this book.
A lot of young readers’ books nowadays seem to have a paranormal theme. This book has characters who are, well, mind readers. In the beginning I was concerned that this might end up being a cheap copy of the Twilight, but actually the plot had some interesting twists and turns.
</P>

Diane Sanfilippo: Practical Paleo</H3>
<P>
The book’s full title is: Practical Paleo: A Customized Approach to Health and a Whole-Foods Lifestyle. And yes, I think the person who comes up with these must really loathe my attempts to put the book title in post title.
Anyway this was an interesting book. Tina (from Carrots’n’Cake) has been telling how she loves this book is and I decided to give it a try. Kindle is not the best thing for reading recipe books, but tablet version is good enough for me (because I don’t like paying the overseas mailing costs and waiting). This book has tons of useful information and meal plans for helping people with different nutrient related illnesses, such as diabetes or IBS. I haven’t really changed my diet much, but that is because I pretty much do most of the recommendations and the rest are a bit tough to adapt. There are references to studies, making it all more believable. I haven’t really cooked anything according to the recipes despite telling myself maybe I could. It might say more  about me than the book, though.

Gretchen Rubin: Happier at Home</H3>
<P>
The book title is “Happier at Home: Kiss More, Jump More, Abandon a Project, Read Samuel Johnson, and My Other Experiments in the Practice of Everyday Life” and sometimes I wonder if someone comes up with extra long titles just to annoy me and my attempt to include the book name in the URL.

For Gretchen, five years have passed, but for me there is a bit too much repetition since I just read her first happiness themed book. Maybe this book would feel better for me if I read a chapter a month. Yes, I like it, but maybe it is a bit too much too soon. Reading how Gretchen struggled with some of her resolutions reminded me that change isn’t easy.

Harry Harrison: The Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat</H3>
<P>
This book includes “The Stainless Steel Rat” “The Stainless Steel Rat’s Revenge” and “The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World”.

These are a good balance to my self improvement reading. No need to analyse and think too much. Just let the adventure unfold as I read. I had read the first one before and remembered some of the key events of the plot. It was good to recall some of the forgotten the details, though. I always enjoy science fiction and the endless possibilities it has to take me anywhere with machines and technology the author has made to life.

Susan Cain: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking</H3>
<P>
I started reading this book before I read The Emotional Life of Your Brain and picked it up right after finishing the other one. I was disappointed to find this book to promote the idea that once you are born introvert, you will always be one. Right when I was fascinated with the idea of being able to change your brain for the better. But fortunately I got over that mindset and kept reading to understand what Susan Cain is trying to say: I will always love my “me time”. And I don’t have to try to change that. Not changing anyone, but empowering them by understanding where they are strong and embracing that. And also being able to identify where they struggle.

I am recommending this book to everyone who is wondering what is wrong with them when they feel just tired of people (especially in large groups), or anyone who wants to understand their introvert friends or coworkers, or children better. A lot of research has been put into this book. There are different viewpoints as well, naturally some hit home better than the others.

Gretchen Rubin: The Happiness Project</H3>
<P>
I borrowed this book from a friend. The whole name of the book is “The Happiness Project: Or, Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun”. The book has a lot of useful insight. The lack of hard references occasionally bothered me, but I did what I usually do: believe in what makes sense to me. After all, one happiness project does not fit all. To “be yourself” is important and is stated in the book multiple times. I like the way Gretchen’s happiness project is split into months with a theme to each of them.

I actually got a lot from this book. An important message is to pay attention to things I do daily and not concentrate only on big things that happen once in a blue moon. I also need to remind myself to do good deeds for myself, not for praise. But for me, the bottom line is to do things that make me feel good, despite the required effort.

Richard J. Davidson with Sharon Begley: The Emotional Life of Your Brain</H3>
<P>
I was fascinated by all the science behind emotions. I really liked this book, it is easy to read and has a nice flow in it while infested with scientific procedures describing measuring brains and emotions. There are instructions for analyzing your emotional style, consisting of six dimensions. Your emotional style has been developing over the years of your life but it is also something you can choose to change. You might be just happy with the way you are: no emotional style is better than the others, no score is the desired perfect score. I like the fact that this book is not about making everyone the same: it is about finding scientific evidence that you can change your emotions by training your brain. And naturally there are instructions on how to change the most commonly bothersome emotional styles .

Harry Harrison: A Stainless Steel Rat Is Born</H3>
<P>
The hero of this book and entire series of adventures is a mastermind criminal. He is not a misunderstood kid who had no choice. He most definitely chose crime as his career. This is not the first book written of the adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat, but it does describe the beginnings, so I chose to start reading from here. I recall reading one book of the series before, but can’t remember which one. I enjoyed reading this book almost as much as I enjoyed the sunshine on the balcony where I sat reading. I will surely read more Stainless Steel Rat adventures.

Ryan Robert: The Ultimate Beginners Running Guide: The Key To Running Inspired</H3>
<P>
I saw this book mentioned somewhere and got a free sample. I was immediately hooked when I read about body chemistry and physiology and bought the book. It was true to the title, though: it is targeted to novices, and I am not a novice. Therefore most of the content was something I already knew, or didn’t experience myself. For instance I am not embarrassed to go out for a run.

There are a lot of facts (or maybe factoids, since there aren’t any sources mentioned) to support running as a foundation for a fitness routine. I kept reading for the interesting information. The book was somewhat short and despite initial promising it was sticking to basics. For instance nutrition (that I am really interested in) was touched really briefly. Maybe not worth the price after all.

Drew Manning and Ryan Pierce Bradley: Fit2Fat2Fit: The Unexpected Lessons from Gaining and Losing 75 lbs on Purpose</H3>
<P>
I have been following Drew Manning’s blog already in the fit2fat stage and I like his writing style. That was the reason for getting this book. I got some insight into what it is like to be fat. Not that I will be a personal trainer in the (near) future. It is regardless interesting to hear the first hand experienced differences. And the part abut food cravings really hit home with my dietary attempts. I have to admit I was hoping there would be more story.

The book is half storytelling, half recipes and fitness instructions. I don’t think the recipes don’t work well in kindle format. I would want to bookmark more than one, in book format I would most likely have little stickers on my favorite recipes and bookmark the meal plan where I am, and exercise plan, too. Kindle unfortunately does not support this kind of behavior well. On the other hand, I don’t think I would have been enthusiastic to wait for the book to arrive in a dead tree form (=paper). I was eager to read it and it did not disappoint me. I am most likely to dig in to the meal plan and take the best parts and incorporate them to my own meal plans.

Oliver Burkeman: The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t Stand Positive Thinking</H3>
<P>
I have been reading a column in the Guardian by Oliver Burkeman for a while. When I found out about his new book, I immediately wanted to read it. And I was right: I really liked this book. Most of the viewpoints are worth thinking about, at least for me. I have never been a fan of positive thinking. Yes, I try every now and then. But I am relieved happiness isn’t dependent on it! Most likely I will end up re-reading this book after a while to gain new perspectives again.

John Joseph Adams (Editor): The Way of the Wizard</H3>
<P>
This book is a collection of short stories about the wizard world from various authors including Orson Scott Card, Neil Gaiman and George RR Martin. I actually read this book over several months’ time. I devoured a story at the time on my spare moments. Some were really good, some weren’t that much to my taste. But maybe that is just a personal preference. When I got this book I was looking forward to reading stories from authors I already knew, but I was happy to find some others whose stories I enjoyed a lot. Even though I really liked this book it took me a long time to finish it up. The stories do differ from each other a lot, so the “I can’t put this down until I’m done” only lasts to the end of a story.

Robert A. Heinlein: The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</H3>
<P>
This science fiction book tells a story about a revolution. I am not interested enough in politics to enjoy the details of building a government. The science fiction part is nevertheless intriguing. Age is showing a bit: this book was written almost fifty years ago. On the other hand it is interesting to read what Robert A. Heinlein thought the future could bring and compare it to how things have developed.

Bruce Schneier: Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive</H3>
<P>
I have to admit I bought this book because I am a huge fan of Bruce Schneier and read about the book on his blog. I was not disappointed at this book at all. It had everything I was expecting and more. I am intrigued by the human nature and Schneier is very thoroughly introducing different aspects and viewpoints. He has solid understanding of how the society works and great ideas on how to make it work better.

There are a lot of notes. It is sometimes a bit disrupting to the flow of reading to jump back and forth to the notes, but I found them very informative regardless. The book wouldn’t be the same without the notes.

I had some technical difficulties with this book in Kindle Touch. Some tables did not show right when they should have spanned to the next page.

Eoin Colfer: Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident</H3>
<P>
I read this book at the request of my daughter, who wanted to read the same book with me and discuss. We have also read the first book of Artemis Fowl series together. Sharing reading experiences with my kids is fun. And I have to admit I enjoy reading the adventures of Artemis Fowl, despite them being clearly targeted for young readers. Beware that this is the second book of Artemis Fowl series: knowing the characters from the first book is important for getting the their roles and some inside jokes.

I am all for different role models for kids to connect to. Artemis is the smart (nerdy) boy who is with no doubt chosen last for the P.E. team.

Tracy Reifkind: The Swing</H3>
<P>
The book is called “The Swing!: Lose the Fat and Get Fit with This Revolutionary Kettlebell Program” I might have been expecting too much, but for me this book wasn’t worth the price. Sure, the introduction to kettlebell swing is good, but over half of the book was filled with things that did not bring any value to me: I don’t have that much fat to lose, I have been cooking my meals for all of my adult life. All I wanted was kettlebell advice and routines. The routines introduced in the book just consist of two hand swings and one hand swings. I found the book useful for honing my technique, but not worth the relatively high price tag as cooking and diet advice was waste of my reading time.

M.P. McDonald: No Good Deed</H3>
<P>
I bought this book for very cheap for my Kindle a while ago and then forgot all about the book. No Good Deed is a psychological thriller. I wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but now I know: I found it hard to put this book away. This is the first book of Mark taylor series. The product description on Amazon says “Mark Taylor discovers first hand that no good deed goes unpunished when the old camera he found during a freelance job in an Afghanistan bazaar gives him more than great photos. It triggers dreams of disasters. Tragedies that happen exactly as he envisions them. He learns that not only can he see the future, he can change it.” As you might guess, things aren’t nice and easy. Some things are not trivial to just change and Mark Taylor’s life gets an unexpected turn.

I found the plot interesting, and to my surprise the charaters and events were quite believable. For me that is an important aspect. Regular people can be heroes and when they are facing unpleasant surroundings, the heroic behavior tends to disappear. And that is where Mark Taylor was at his worst moments. But there is something to him that makes him rise above Joe Average. Something that makes you want his life to sort itself out, even when it is against the odds.

Ernest Cline: Ready Player One</H3>
<P>
Science Fiction can be subtly (or not so subtly) critical about our lifestyle and culture. In this book the setting is in a future world with ever worsening energy crisis and a world wide virtual world where people not only escape their life, but study and work as well. It does not sound too futuristic to begin with, and this book is relatively easy to plunge into.

The book is entertaining, but very heavily relying on the 80s culture knowledge. So I doubt it would be as entertaining to someone who has not been immersed in the 80s culture. Also, some gamer background is a big plus. Half way through the plot stalled a bit, but I was able to plough through to more interesting twists and turns.

Richard K. Morgan: Woken Furies</H3>
<P>
The third Takesh Kovacs novel did not let me down. Action packed adventure brought along some
memories from the past. This book kept me on my toes all through the end. The Takeshi Kovacs books feel to me more action with sci-fi background than just sci-fi. Which is not a bad thing at all, since I enjoy the ride with all the twists and turns.

Kathryn Stockett: The Help</H3>
<P>
This book is an interesting journey to the world of maids in the sixties Mississippi. It gives the racial issues a personal touch. Also, I can’t imagine how short time ago it was. I enjoyed reading this book and the worry and fear of the maids crept through.
I must have been spoiled by the Game of Thrones, and somehow knowing that every main character is going to be ok, dampened the excitement a bit.

Stephenie Meyer: The Host</b><br>
This Science Fiction thriller by Stephenie Meyer wasn’t something I was awfully enthusiastic about. I have read the Twilight Saga and am not a fan. But this book exceeded my expectations and turned out to be an enjoyable read.

<P> 
<b>Cecilia Ahern: The Gift</b><br>
I got this originally as a light travelling read. Got caught up in the story quite nicely despite the moralising part, which felt a bit too pushy at times.
</P>
<P> 
<b>
Stieg Larsson: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire</b><br>
Being a bestseller I just had to start reading this trilogy. It is an interesting read, but a bit too graphic in sex and violence to my taste. I have also seen the original movies made from these books. Haven’t gotten around to read/watch the last part yet.
</P>
<P> 
<b>
John Luciew: Zero Tolerance</b><br>
Story of the lives of teen-aged criminals who are taken to a boot camp. Sometimes it does me a wolrd of good to stepp outside my comfort zone and read about those who haven’t really been dealt the best cards for this game we call life. I went through a set of emotions I’d rather not ever face in real life. But in a book, I enjoyed the ride.
</P>
<P> 
<b>
Rick Riordan: Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</b><br>
I had seen this book made into a movie and end up on the DVD shelf and figured out it might be worth a peek. Me, I usually prefer a book over amovie if both are available, so I wanted to read the book first. I did end up recommending this book to the eleven-year-old and she liked it as well.
</P>
<P> 
<b>
Marta Perry: Hide in Plain Sight</b><br>
A journey to a world very unfamiliar to me, this book takes the reader to Amish country. I got this book because it was free, but ended up not being able to put it down for pages and pages.
</P>
<P> 
<b>Malcolm Gladwell: What the Dog Saw</b><br>
I have read other books by Malcolm Gladwell and enjoyed the insight in them. It was only natural to pick this one up and continue absorbing the wisdom in Gladwell’s writing. Each chapter is an independent story and I ended up having some gaps between chapters here and there (while reading other things).
</P>
<P> 
<b>
Michael Lopp: Being Geek</b><br>
I have read the previous book by Michael Lopp (better known as “Rands”) and learned a lot from it. I devoured every bit of insight this book had to offer. A warning note, regardless: this is a book about geeks. It will help you understand the geeky traits in you (or someone you know), but it is also assuming a lot of geeky behavour in you (or that someone else you are driving to understand). I am not that geeky, so I found a lot of the information not so helpful to me.

<b>
Carlos Ruiz Zafon : The Angel’s Game</b><br>
By the author of The Shadow of the Wind I was intrigued yet again by times in the past and romance and tragedy. This was a breathtaking book with dark secrets. I found myself reading it at wee hours instead of sleeping.
</P>
<P> 
<b>Richard K. Morgan: Altered Carbon, Broken Angels</b><br>
Originally recommended by a friend, a very enjoyable series of books describing scifi adventures of Takeshi Kovacs, who finds out things don’t always (if ever) go smoothly as planned. I enjoy the worlds and technology Richard K. Morgan has in his books. There is also a lot of action (always a good thing, right?).
</P>
<P> 
<b>Suzanne Collins: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay</b><br>
I started reading this because a friend recommended it. I really loved the first book, but the other two weren’t quite that good. This is a science fiction book series, set somewhere in the future of the United States. The book is a part love story and a part adventure, albeit a very dangerous one. There is a lot of violence and death and therefore despite being targeted to young readers, I can’t recommend these books to my eleven-year-old yet.
</P>
<P> 
<b>Daniel Suarez: Daemon, Freedom</b><br>
Originally found on Missy Meyer’s blog. I have found out I have a somewhat similar taste in books than she has, so all I had to see was nine stars out of ten and science fiction and there I was, clicking for purchase in Amazon. Although I found myself giggling at some of the computer science inventions, I enjoyed reading these two books.
</P>
<P> 
<b>Timothy Ferriss: The 4-Hour Body</b><br>
I had heard bits and pieces of information on this book from various sources and finally gave in to getting a copy. I can relate to Ferriss’ style of wanting information about everything. His eating rules are quite simple and easy to follow. The exercise part is harder to adopt, despite easy to follow pictures, videos and descriptions. All in all, supports well most of my food ideology. A reference book I will (hopefully) go back to every now and then.
</P>
<P> 
<b>
Bernard Cornwell: The Last Kingdom (Alfred the Great 1)</b><br>
Found this book from a local computer gamer’s magazine editor’s reading list. I thought I could go for something different and grabbed this historical book from the late ninth century England. Danes and Englismen fight for ruling English kingdoms in a very nicely drawn and believable manner. This book reminded me about Viking history which I have been interested in for a while and left me wanting to read more.
</P>
<P> 
<b>Eoin Colfer: Artemis Fowl</b><br>
This book is also from the list of book series to young readers that would make fun TV series. The main character of this book is Artemis Fowl, who is a twelve-year-old criminal mastermind. He ended up being part snotty kid and part having more sense than his years would let to expect. I handed this book over to the eleven-year-old reader. She was not thrilled at first at fairies not being quite Tinkerbell-ish creatures, but got a grip of things quickly enough.
</P>
<P> 
<b>George R. R. Martin: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows</b><br>
The most refreshing thing in this castle age adventure book is that you can’t be quite sure who are the heroes and who are the villains. The books take different perspectives of different characters and at times it is not easy to follow who and where we are talking about. Especially in the beginning of a new book. Beware also: there is a lot of death and violence.
</P>

<H3>Dale Carnegie: How to Win Friends and Influence People 7.6.2009</H3>
<P>
Dale Carnegie recommends marking important things in the book and that is basically why I wanted a copy of my own. And I surely hope this was just the first read-through of the book and that I will end up picking it up again from the bookshelf where it is placed next to “Getting Things Done”.

How to Win Friends and Influence People has pages and pages of practical advise and examples. Every here and there the age shows: the book originates in the 30s and even though it has been updated since most of the examples ate quite old. But human character hasn’t changed: I believe everything applies now as accurately as in US civil war ages.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to communicate better: be it with your parents, children, friends, neighbors, work mates. Just anyone can benefit from knowing basic principles of how people are affected by your choice of words and attitude. Instead of dwelling over bad luck in relationships it is always better to know ways to deal with situations and people.

The bottom line this book has taught me is to always ask “what’s in it for me?”. Especially in trying to persuade someone else, put yourself in his shoes and ask this question. It is a real eye-opener.

</P>

<H3>Malcolm Gladwell: Outliers  7.6.2009</H3>
<P>
I learned about this book from Randy Cassingham and I was immediately intrigued, so I put it on my shopping list. Later, when I got the book and picked it up, I was immediately hooked.

Most of it makes perfect sense to me. I have seen so many people land good jobs just by being at the right place at the right time. And then again, seen many people fail to find something they desire (be it a spouse or a nice job) for no apparent reason. Quite a lot of an ordinary success lies in hard work and practicing, but to really hit the jackpot cannot happen without being at the right place at the right time.

Gladwell writes: “It is not the brightest who succeeded. […] Nor is success simply the sum of efforts and decisions we make on our behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities – and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.”

What more can I add to that?

<H3>Lucy & Stephen Hawking: George’s Secret key to the Universe 11.6.2009</H3>
<P>
I read from the New Scientist a review of the books Stephen Hawking has written with his daughter Lucy and being the curious person I am, I had to start reading them. The story line is nice and there are plenty of facts about the universe. Too bad there is not a Finnish translation available, for my little daughter to read. I enjoyed this one enough to gulp down the sequel immediately after putting this one down from my hands.

Lucy & Stephen Hawking: George’s Cosmic Treasure Hunt 12.6.2009
The second George adventure didn’t let me down either. There are essays from some of the top scientists and that is a really nice addition. George’s adventures are well written for say, 8 to 10 year-olds.
</P>

<H3>Neil Gaiman: Anansi Boys 14.6.2009</H3>
<P>
Now for something more adult for a change. The best thing about being sick is that you have an excuse to lie down and read all day (or two days…). I just love Neil Gaiman’s writing. And Anansi Boys didn’t let me down at all. This book is about mythology (Anansi the trickster is a spider-god) and about parental embarrassment and relationships. Just stir the plot with twists and turns that just are so weird they naturally do make sense and you are in for one fun ride. I am just amazed at the worlds that exist in Neil Gaiman’s imagination, and thankful for him to share them with his readers.
</P>

<H3>Neil Gaiman: The Graveyard Book 23.6.2009</H3>
<P>
Can you tell already I enjoy Neil Gaiman’s books? The main character in this book is a little boy who ends up being raised on a graveyard, mostly by the ghosts and other creatures who reside there. The boy is named Nobody Owens, but his friends call him Bod. He ends up in adventures that would seem totally out of place anywhere else, but on a graveyard. What I like the most in Neil Gaiman’s books is the way how things just flow naturally along, despite being totally unnatural. You just could not even imagine most of the things that happen to Bod, but when you read about them, strangely they just make perfect sense.

I decided to continue the Ender series after a while. I guess I won with the long break, because I had a lot of “ooh I remember this” moments while reading. I do have to agree, though: this was not as good as the previous one, but I look forward to starting the final book.

Carlos Ruiz Zafon: The Shadow of the Wind
I borrowed this book from a friend quite a while ago. He recommended it, but for some reason it was pushed back in my reading queue for a while. When I finally started, the book caught me right from the first pages. I was surprised by the strength of emotions it stirred inside me. I often found myself carrying the book with me, just to sneak in a minute or two of reading here and there.

There are enough pearls of wisdom in The Shadow of the Wind to build a necklace from. Little things here and there pepper the storyline that is winding around the main character with surprising twists and events. My favorite quote from the book is: “Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you”.

Like a good book should, The Shadow of the Wind opened a door for a shade of sadness in my heart while turning the last pages. It is the feeling of knowing you have made a friend, who you will never meet again. (I guess that is why I hate sequels, I don’t want to stay waiting for a reunion, fearing that the friend I have made will no longer be the same.)

Philip Pullman: The Amber Spyglass</H3>
<P>
I finally got the last book of His Dark Materials trilogy read. It was a  bit of a chore rather than pure enjoyment, but I wanted to know how it ends and if there is a meaning to everything that happened. The answer is yes, the separate plots and bits and pieces of this trilogy are finally connected and explained.

I did not find it easy to follow the book, because most of the plot(s) was scattered around the main characters in their journeys in the different worlds. Some of the events did not make any sense until way later.

I don’t know whether I was expecting a happy ending or not, but as the readers of my blog must know by now: I seriously dislike “there might be a sequel” endings. And this book had an ending that was merely a beginning.

</P>

<H3> 22.3.2009
Randy Pausch: The Last Lecture</H3>
<P>
I have seen the lecture in YouTube and that is why I got the book from Amazon.com. I guess my instinct was to give a handful of dollars to a man who helped me tweak my views on life. Not that is makes a huge difference to him, but it makes a huge difference on me to do that. Nevertheless, the book got stuck in my to-do pile, somewhere in the middle and I forgot what impact the Last Lecture had had on me. I re-found my love for reading after deciding to let go of my studies. And there, tucked neatly in the pile of books I wanted to read was the Last Lecture. So I grabbed it for a weekend of recovering from common cold and read it while pretending to just regain my strength under a warm blanket.
<br>
I was touched again, by the positiveness of Randy Pausch, by his enthusiasm and not giving in. I want more of that attitude in my life. I am not happy with where the Eeyoreness has taken me, so I try to give my inner Tigger a chance. And if everything else fails, at least I want to be remembered by my kids as someone who encouraged positive thinking and trying again if facing a brick wall. Even if it ends up being all a huge head fake it will hopefully be worth it.
<br>
For those who got lost somewhere between my choice of words in the previous paragraph: you need to read the book. Randy Pausch believed strongly in recycling cliches. And I have shamelessly reused some of his words that felt like they made sense to me.

<H3> 2.2.2009
Stephenie Meyer: Twilight</H3>
<P>
My (older) daughter went to see the movie and wanted to read the book and then the entire series. While talking to a bookstore saleswoman while hunting the fourth book for her I finally grasped it: the books are not about vampires or supernatural things, they are about a young woman in love. I guess the movie critics who were disappointed had had the same expectations I had gotten from the movie trailer. I am more into the gory vampire tales, but since she has been raving about the books I decided to read Twilight.
<br>
My teenage years are long gone, but I can still remember what it was like to be young. And I get it why the books appeal to young girls. A love story between an ordinary girl and a mysterious, potentially very dangerous creature is a thrilling read to a girl who either believes or wants to believe in true love.
<br>
I can’t deny it: I did like the book nevertheless. It was nicely written and had some witty humor here and there. The ordinary girl is easy to identify with: she is not extraordinarily pretty, she carries her weight at school without being a genius and a she is more than just tad bit clumsy. And he is something else: breathtakingly beautiful, strong and has supernatural abilities. Oh and he is also a vampire. If she was smart, she’d run the opposite direction now. But I guess it is true: love is blind. And completely ignorant of real life obstacles. To my delight the book also has a scary part with blood-thirsty vampires as well, where she gets into a dire danger.
<br>
I just can’t make my mind up whether it is a good or a bad thing the book leaves room for sequels. I guess a love story between a vampire and a human cannot just close with a happily ever after scene. I just wish we did not live in a world where the biggest cash is to be made with sequels and stories would just be stories that would lure you to their magic and then be over despite your desire to clutch to the last pages, reluctant to let go.

Judith Rich Harris: The Nurture Assumption</H3>
<P>
If I had to blame someone for the housing bubble, I’d vote for Judith Rich Harris. She is basically saying the thing to do to give your kids a better chance in life is to give them a better school and that is achieved through a better neighborhood. This book was published in 1998 and I have seen the trend in the United Stated: parents are buying their kids a school in their home location choices. It is not that obvious in Finland: you can still to some extent, choose the school your child is attending regardless of where you live. But there are obviously better and worse schools, and better and worse peer groups.
<br>
I got this book to pat me on the back when I decided to lobby a science high school for my daughter, believing that she would do better in a “nerdy” environment than risking being the only nerd in her class in the local high school. Judith Rich Harris does everything to support my view and more. I did finally read this book now that I already know how the school was and what were the benefits and drawbacks. It was a fascinating trip to the things I have experienced, backed up with research, complete with references.
<br>
The only thing I disagree heavily about is do parents matter. Judith Rich Harris goes all the way to shrug off similarities between a parent and offspring in views, opinions and talents, to genetics. Naturally there is a connection, but we still can’t tell how much is shaped by genetics and how much my environment, including home. I still believe parents can lead by example and that the moral and ethichs can be learned from parents, not only one’s peers. And that is how I plan to continue raising my kids.

Maria Shriver: And One More Thing Before You Go…</H3>
<P>
I was curious to read what Maria Shriver would have to say to High School graduating girls. Most of her advise is along the lines of my own beliefs. The book is short, it is actually a speech given to graduating girls.  As a speech, the book is nicely motivating and thought provoking. I just might pass this along to my daughter on her graduation.

Cory Doctorow: Anda’s Game</H3>
<P>
I dug this out the net as it was mentioned in Jinx trivia a while ago. Not just because I didn’t know the answer, but because I had recently quit (ok, I am more than likely to get back once the summer is over) playing WoW. I was curious to read about a young girl in a virtual world. I was delighted to see the multitude of issues addressed in this short story. Many of the things hit home in a pleasant way, and I was happy to see Anda do what I consider the right thing.

Philip Pullman: The Subtle Knife</H3>
<P>
This is the second book of the “His Dark Materials” trilogy. It is every bit as enjoyable as the first one (the Golden Compass, which was also recently released as a DVD). Lyra’s adventures continue with Will, a boy whose fate seems to be as strongly tangled in the roots of the upcoming events as Lyra’s ever is.
<br>
The sheer idea of parallel universe is an intriguing one. The amount of imagination Pullman puts to his universe is huge. Pullman does not hesitate to shock either, something I find refreshing in a care bear world of a well-protected life I lead. Too much disneying is not my thing. At times it is hard to follow who is who, where and why, but I am looking forward to the rest of the pieces finding their places in the last part of the trilogy.

Matthieu Ricard: Happiness</H3>
<P>
This book boldly claims to be “a guide to developing life’s most important skill”. I guess that is what caught my eye in a bookstore in London last June. I bought the book, telling myself happiness is worth developing. And started reading. Now this is not a book to speed through, I spent ten months reading it. At least I just had to think through things that the book stated. There exercises in this book and most of them are quite useful.
<br>
One of the things I really like in this book is the “scientific” attitude it has. There are a lot of references and notes to publications. It gives me the reassurance there is some research behind the things stated in the book. The only drawback I can pinpoint is that the Buddhist monk life is so distant to everything I have, it is sometimes really hard to relate.
<br>
Matthieu Ricard writes: “In the whirlwind of daily life, we often feel so hurt and drained that we are too weak even to do the exercises that would give us strength.” Now this I can relate to all too well. But that will not keep me from cherishing my happiness as he some chapters later continues: “anyone can set aside a few minutes a day, and occasionally a day or two, to sit and look clearly into his own mind and into his perception of the world around him. This is as essential as sleep to one who is exhausted or as fresh air to one who has long breathed the polluted air of the city.” That was exactly what I was doing in London: setting some time off to think, when I picked up this book in a bookstore.
<br>
One memorable thing about this book is that I read it on a cool summer day on the railway station in Oulu, and a by-passer stopped to wish me happiness in my life. (No, that is not a common thing to happen in Finland.) So, I guess you are going to ask now: well am I happier? The answer is yes. Some of it is surely credited to this book, but just reading a book will not make anyone happy. You have to work on it, develop the skill yourself.

Michael Lopp: Managing Humans</H3>
<P>
I got this book basically because I am reading the author’s blog, Rands in Repose. In a way the book was a blog, too. The chapters were stories rather than forming a clear plot to everything. Now, in my NADD mind there is nothing wrong with individual chapter-stories. And I like this guy’s writing style and he has a lot of insight of being a manager and working for a manager. I feel I got a tidbit of useful information here and there and everywhere. All in all a good read and I recommend it to anyone who is even thinking about being a manager… or working for one.

Neil Gaiman: Odd and the Frost Giants</H3>
<P>
When I read that Neil Gaiman is contributing to the World Book Day, I rushed to Amazon.co.uk and ordered a copy of Odd and the Frost Giants. If you want someone to guide you for a crash course in Norwegian mythology, all dressed up in a tale of a very special child, get this beautifully illustrated book and start reading. Neil Gaiman has never let me down, and there was no fear of it this time either. The only drawback this book has is that it was all over too soon and left me wanting more fantasy and magic to dive in. I recommended this to a teenager who is interested in fantasy books, despite the small challenges of reading in English.

Philip Pullman: Northern Lights</H3>
<P>
I saw a trailer for the movie made from this book and being a curious person I wanted to read the book, and later maybe see the movie. The book is targeted for young readers and it is praised for the imaginative setting of the world it describes.
<br>
I found the book enjoyable to read and I am glad I have the sequels waiting for me already, as I will surely be digging into the next one soon. The main character is a young girl, who is pictured quite believably, judged by a mom of two daughters.
