Professional me
---------------
I am a Software Test Engineer. Currently I do mostly Test Automation because, let's be honest: that is what drives agile development. You need to check that the changes aren't breaking the core functionality (and preferably not much else either) and then you just go ahead and deploy, and then patch later if needed. That is the way software development works in today's world. Most of the people who have worked with me know that I have a lot of ideas about how testing is not a mandatory rubber stamp at the end of the waterfall. A good tester benefits the entire team by participating and asking all the right (stupid) questions before any bugs or undesired features have been entered into the software. That requires a load of insight and product and business expertise. And needless to say, it is not easy getting there. Especially for me, because I'd rather not be the center of attention. I most especially hate public speaking. And no, don't think you can fix me. I don't need to be fixed. I am just fine the way I am, thank you.

Personal me
-----------
The shore is my favorite place on earth. I could stay there watching the waves for ever. Well, at least for the entire summer. I am definitely a summer person: I love sunshine, and warmth. And not having to dress in several layers of clothes. I run, mostly for heath reasons over fitness reasons. But then again, they are essentially the same. But when it comes to running faster or further, if it starts to stress me I just don't do it. I don't really care about being better every day. I just care about not getting significantly worse every day. I would love to be a gym person, but I just don't feel like I belong. It is easier for me to just run through the forest during the early morning hours when it feels like I have the entire forest just for me. And the deer. When indoors, I like to listen to music, read books or watch movies or TV series.
